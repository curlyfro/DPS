## Issues Encountered
- Layer 3: Minor warnings about method hiding (non-critical)

## Next Steps
1. Create DocumentUpload.razor component
2. Implement drag-and-drop functionality
3. Add progress tracking
4. Create document list component
5. Test file upload through UI

## Important Notes

- Following systematic layer-by-layer approach
- Will test at each milestone
- Layer 1-3 completed successfully
- 40% complete (4 of 10 layers)
- Build successful with 46 warnings (method hiding and platform-specific code)
