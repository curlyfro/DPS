We will create a standardized, globally accessible workshop program for AWS Transform for .NET tools to address low adoption rates caused by limited awareness and fragmented regional resources. A cross-regional team of Solution Architects from AMER, EMEA, and APJ will collaborate with service teams to develop comprehensive, up-to-date workshop content that can be delivered consistently across AWS Summits and translated into key regional languages like Japanese and Spanish. This initiative will provide customers with immersive, hands-on learning experiences that accelerate adoption of .NET modernization tools and support efficient migration from .NET Framework to .NET 8. Success will be measured through workshop attendance, engagement levels, tool adoption rates, impacted ARR, and customer feedback scores, creating a scalable knowledge-sharing mechanism that operates effectively in the absence of the original creators.
