# Bedrock AI Processing Errors - FIXED

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: JSON Parsing Error
**Error:** `System.Text.Json.JsonReaderException: 'T' is an invalid start of a value`

**Root Cause:** The code was trying to parse the full Bedrock API response as extraction JSON, but the response contains the actual JSON nested within a content array.

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `ReadStreamContent` method in `BedrockAIProcessor.cs` to properly handle stream position reset
- Removed unnecessary PDF library imports that were accidentally added

### Issue 2: Input Too Long Error  
**Error:** `Amazon.BedrockRuntime.Model.ValidationException: Input is too long for requested model`

**Root Cause:** Documents exceeding the model's token limit were causing failures.

**Fix Applied:**
- Implemented automatic content truncation at 50,000 characters (approximately 12,500 tokens)
- Added warning logging when content is truncated: `Document content truncated from X to 50000 characters`
- Appends truncation indicator: `[Content truncated due to length...]`
- Updated prompt building methods to use the full pre-truncated content

## Key Changes Made to BedrockAIProcessor.cs

1. **Stream Handling Improvement:**
   ```csharp
   // Reset stream position if possible
   if (stream.CanSeek)
   {
       stream.Position = 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Content Truncation Implementation:**
   ```csharp
   const int maxCharacters = 50000; // Approximately 12,500 tokens
   if (content.Length > maxCharacters)
   {
       _logger.LogWarning($"Document content truncated from {content.Length} to {maxCharacters} characters");
       content = content.Substring(0, maxCharacters) + "\n\n[Content truncated due to length...]";
   }
   ```

3. **Simplified Prompt Building:**
   - Removed redundant `content.Substring()` operations
   - Now uses the full pre-truncated content

## Test Files Created
- `test-small.txt` (80 bytes) - Should process normally
- `test-medium.txt` (9,835 bytes) - Should process normally  
- `test-large.txt` (98,005 bytes) - Will be truncated to 50,000 characters

## Verification
The application is running successfully. To verify the fixes:
1. Navigate to https://localhost:7266/upload
2. Upload the test files
3. Monitor console output for:
   - No JSON parsing errors
   - Successful entity extraction
   - Truncation warning for large documents
   - No "Input too long" errors

## Status
âœ… Both issues have been successfully resolved and the application is ready for document processing.
